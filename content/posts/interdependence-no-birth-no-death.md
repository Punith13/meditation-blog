## Meditation Practice: Expansive Awareness

We began with meditation practice, which is a process of coming to know our own mind—both its restlessness and its tendencies to think and ruminate and be affected by moods and emotional states, and the underlying awareness that has the ability to hold the entire field of our experience like the vast sky holds the clouds.

The practice of meditation, then, is to remain in awareness, and be like **"the sky gazing down on the clouds that pass through it."**

Here's how Sogyal Rinpoche expresses this in chapter five of the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying:

> So whatever thoughts and emotions arise, allow them to rise and settle, like the waves in the ocean. Whatever you find yourself thinking, let that thought rise and settle, without any constraint. Don't grasp at it, feed it, or indulge it; don't cling to it and don't try to solidify it. Neither follow thoughts nor invite them; be like the ocean looking at its own waves, or the sky gazing down on the clouds that pass through it.

## Cognitive Habits That Distort Reality

When resting in that spacious, skylike awareness, we will notice that some experiences—thoughts, emotions, perceptions—have the power, or the pull, to draw us in. At the basis of this are our mind's basic habits to solidify reality in terms of **permanent, single, independent things**.

First and foremost amongst these is our "self" or "identity," which when we investigate a little bit, can easily be unmasked as a complete fiction: we relate to ourselves as single, independent, and lasting persons, yet everything we normally think of as us is constantly changing, multiple, and deeply interdependent with everything else.

### Partial Analysis and Truth

Our "ordinary definition of truth" results from **"partial analysis"**. We stop analyzing when we reach a comfortable answer or get what we want. The Buddha (Siddhartha) continued his analysis "further and further" until all things that had the power to entice him were reduced to atoms, and even atoms dissolved. This **"finding nothing there, he was free from disappointment"**.

This idea can be existentially challenging, as we are "invested in the things we think are there." But the disillusionment that comes from realizing that the things we've always considered so important are no more real than a dream, or the illusion of a ring of fire, is really quite liberating, and allows us to find what is really true.

## The Third Cognitive Habit: Interdependence

The third cognitive habit that distorts reality is **seeing ourselves as independent agents**.

### Thich Nhat Hanh: "The Universe Explained in a Sheet of Paper"

The Vietnamese Buddhist master Thich Nhat Hanh beautifully illustrates interdependence through a simple sheet of paper.

#### "Non-Paper Elements"

By looking deeply into a sheet of paper, one can see elements like:
- **Clouds** (rain for trees)
- **Trees** (for pulp)
- **Earth** and minerals
- **Sunshine**

These are all **"non-paper elements"** without which the paper "cannot be there."

#### No Birth, No Creation

The paper is a **"continuation,"** not a "creation" from nothing. It didn't suddenly come into existence—it emerged from countless causes and conditions.

#### No Death, Only Transformation

Similarly, when a cloud becomes rain, it's not death but **"only a moment of continuation."** A cloud cannot be "reduced to nothing"; it transforms into rain, snow, hail, or ice. Even burning paper transforms it into heat, smoke, and ash, which continue in other forms.

#### The True Nature

The true nature of paper, a cloud, or a flame is the **"nature of no coming, nor going. No birth, no death"**.

## Contemplation on Interdependence

### Applying to Mind

When you touch your present mind, you are touching the minds of all who taught you, interacted with you, and every occurrence in your life that shaped it.

Your thoughts, beliefs, language, and knowledge are not solely "yours"—they are influenced by countless others. We are **"bundles of others"** with no single origin.

### Applying to Body

Your body, like the sheet of paper, cannot exist without the universe being what it is. **"When you touch your body, you are literally touching the entire universe."**

Every atom in your body was forged in the heart of a star. Every breath you take connects you to the atmosphere, to plants, to all living beings. Your body is made of food, which is made of earth, water, and sun.

### Implications

This contemplation helps to:

- **"Loosen up"** fixed ideas about what's possible and how things are
- Create a sense of **"being and moving through time"** and "collaborating" with other things
- Break through boundaries that were **"never really there"**
- Reveal that things are never stuck, as **"stuckness is basically our habit"** of seeing things as permanent, separate, and singular
- Show that birth and death are **"mental constructs that were never real in the first place"**

## Benefits of Understanding Interdependence

### Cultivating Wonderment and Curiosity

This approach cultivates a sense of **"wonderment"** and **"curiosity"**. It helps to recognize that **"nothing is just... straightforward and is what it is right here and now"**.

### Awakening Intelligence

Notions of multiplicity, impermanence, and interdependence **"awaken your intelligence"** and encourage us to **"ask questions rather than approach your reality with preset answers"**.

This process is about awakening our **"spirit of inquiring"** and intelligence, rather than being "spoon-fed answers."

### Freedom from Birth and Death

The promise of this understanding is that **"birth and death are, in fact, again, creations of our own mind"**.

If we relate to reality differently, seeing things in their true nature **"beyond birth and beyond death,"** there is **"only continuation"**.

Only when we see the paper, ourselves, anything or anyone, as an independent entity, is there birth and death. But when we connect with reality on a deeper level, there is no birth and no death—only transformation, only continuation.

## Practice This Week

### The Paper Meditation

1. **Hold a sheet of paper** (or any object)
2. **Look deeply** into it
3. **See the non-paper elements**: clouds, rain, trees, earth, sun, loggers, paper mill workers, their parents, their food...
4. **Notice**: Where does the paper begin? Where does it end?
5. **Realize**: The entire universe is present in this sheet of paper

### The Body Meditation

1. **Sit quietly** and bring awareness to your body
2. **Feel your breath**: Where did this air come from? Trees, oceans, the atmosphere...
3. **Feel your heartbeat**: What powers it? Food, which came from earth, sun, rain...
4. **Sense your bones**: Made of calcium from ancient seas, from dying stars...
5. **Realize**: You are not separate from the universe—you ARE the universe experiencing itself

### The Mind Meditation

1. **Notice a thought** arising
2. **Ask**: Where did this thought come from?
3. **Trace it back**: A conversation, a book, a teacher, their teachers, their experiences...
4. **See**: Your mind is a continuation of countless minds
5. **Realize**: There is no independent "you" thinking—there is only the universe thinking through this particular form

## Reflection Questions

- If you are deeply interconnected with everything, what does "death" really mean?
- How does understanding interdependence change your sense of responsibility?
- What boundaries in your life are "mental constructs that were never really there"?
- Can you sense the continuation—the flow—rather than fixed things with beginnings and endings?
- What freedom comes from seeing yourself as a continuation rather than a separate entity?

## The Liberation

When we truly see interdependence, we realize:

- **Nothing is truly born** (it's a continuation of what came before)
- **Nothing truly dies** (it transforms and continues)
- **Nothing is truly separate** (everything interpenetrates everything else)
- **Nothing is truly solid** (everything is a dynamic process)

This isn't nihilism—it's not saying nothing exists. It's saying things exist in a radically different way than we habitually perceive them. They exist as **processes, relationships, continuations**—not as isolated, independent entities.

And in this understanding, there is profound freedom. Freedom from the fear of death. Freedom from the illusion of separation. Freedom to participate fully in the great dance of existence, knowing you are not separate from it—you are it.

*In the sheet of paper, the entire cosmos. In your breath, the whole universe. In this moment, all of time. Nothing separate, nothing independent, nothing truly born, nothing truly dying—only the eternal dance of transformation.* 🌊

**Next Steps**: Continue to look deeply into the things and people around you. See the "non-you elements" in yourself. Notice how boundaries dissolve when you look closely enough. Rest in the awareness that holds it all—the sky that watches the clouds, the ocean that holds the waves.
