## The Two Aspects of Mind: Appearance and Essence

Our mind has two basic aspects that are essential to understand:

### Mind's Appearance

This is how the mind appears and manifests, including **thoughts, emotions, and sense perceptions**. This is the aspect of our mind that we are most familiar with.

And if this is all we're familiar with, we end up solidifying these appearances in the way we've explored in previous classes: we construct an identity—a single, permanent, independent person—from a multiplicity of constantly changing phenomena, each deeply interwoven and interdependent with everything else.

### Mind's Essence (or Nature)

No matter how our mind appears and manifests to us, the underlying essence of these appearances, the basic "mind stuff" is a **basic cognizance, or clarity**. This is referred to as the mind's essence or nature.

It goes by different names in various Buddhist traditions:
- **Clarity**
- **Luminosity**
- **Clear light nature of mind**
- **Pure awareness**

When this pure awareness recognizes its own nature, we call it **buddha nature**, or **rigpa** in the language of the dzogchen teachings.

#### Not a Soul

This buddha nature or rigpa is not the same as the Christian concept of the "soul," which is commonly viewed as an isolated entity, permanent, singular, and independent.

In Buddhism, the nature of mind is **dynamic and arises afresh, anew in every moment**, and can be brought into direct experience through skillful guidance by a qualified teacher and disciplined meditation practice.

## Samsara and Nirvana: Two Directions of Mind

### Samsara: Mind Turned Outwardly, Lost in Its Projections

In the classic, more scholarly tradition of Buddhism, samsara is defined as "the uncontrolled cycle of existence, birth and death, characterized by suffering, determined by disturbing emotions (kleshas) and unwise actions (karma)."

In the practice lineage of dzogchen, samsara is presented—in the words of contemporary dzogchen master Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche—as **"mind turned outwardly, lost in its projections."**

#### What Does This Mean?

When we pay attention to our mind, it is easy to see how we are constantly **pulled into the content** of what our thoughts and sense perceptions present to us, along with the sense of hope, fear, like, dislike, excitement, boredom, and all the other feeling tones that color our thoughts and perceptions.

All this becomes our entire world and reality, and in the process **we lose sight of who we really are**—our mind's essence and true nature.

We end up looking for ourselves outside ourselves, and in the process find ourselves further and further removed from ourselves.

### Nirvana: Mind Turned Inwardly, Recognizing Its Nature

Through the practice of meditation, we can begin to free ourselves from the narrow confines of our mind's projections and our grasping at these projections.

Instead of being pulled into the content of our thoughts and perceptions, we can learn to **remain in the space of awareness**.

This is the aspect of mind we have not familiarized ourselves with very much, mainly because the mind's appearance as thoughts, emotions, and sense perceptions is often so overwhelming, presenting itself as so real and important to us.

But through learning to rest in awareness, we will slowly experience for ourselves that **our awareness is much bigger than our thoughts and emotions**.

Our awareness is like a vast open sky, and our thoughts and emotions are like clouds drifting through the sky.

#### The Recognition

Resting in awareness, then, will be a stepping stone towards **mind recognizing its nature**, where awareness is, as it were, aware of itself and aware of its true nature.

This is presented by Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche as **"nirvana is mind turned inwardly, recognizing its nature."**

## Analogies for Understanding Mind and Its Nature

To help us relate to these concepts, the teachings offer us examples and analogies:

### The Waves and the Ocean

A wave is unique and experiences birth and death, but viewed as a piece of the ocean (water), there is only continuity.

**The waves are made of water**, just as all cognitive content is "made" fundamentally out of clear, cognizant awareness.

Thoughts and emotions are the mind's own radiance and expression, just as the ocean has waves or the sun has rays. **Thoughts rise from the mind and dissolve back into the mind**.

#### Key Insights

- The wave is not separate from the ocean
- The wave's "birth" and "death" are relative appearances
- The water (essence) is always present, unchanging
- Similarly, thoughts are not separate from awareness
- Thoughts arise and dissolve within awareness
- The awareness (essence) is always present

### The Movie Projector

The essence of mind is like the **light bulb at the heart of an old-fashioned film projector**.

The image projected onto the screen (thoughts, life events) is the mind's appearance or manifestation.

#### Samsara: Captivated by the Movie

Samsara is like being fascinated and captivated by the movie—completely absorbed in the drama, believing it to be real, reacting emotionally to every scene.

#### Nirvana: Recognizing the Light

Nirvana is like realizing the movie is only a **"dance of light"** cast by the bulb.

From the light bulb's perspective, the stories in the movie—the stories of our lives—are all completely equal. The dramas, the tragedies, the comedies—they're all just patterns of light.

#### The True Nature Is Always Perfect

**The true nature of our mind is always perfect and okay**, regardless of what appears on the screen.

Through continued meditation practice we can increasingly view our thoughts and emotions with a spacious, open, and compassionate attitude. We learn to relate to their stories as an old wise grandfather would relate to their grandchild's play.

This prevents the "play" of life (such as careers or possessions, likened to sandcastles) from becoming deadly serious.

## Practice: Turning Mind Inward

### Basic Meditation for Recognizing Awareness

1. **Sit comfortably** in meditation posture
2. **Allow thoughts to arise** naturally—don't suppress them
3. **Notice a thought** when it appears
4. **Ask yourself**: "What is aware of this thought?"
5. **Turn attention** from the thought to the awareness itself
6. **Rest** in that awareness, even for a moment
7. **Repeat** as thoughts continue to arise

### The Sky and Clouds Practice

1. **Visualize your awareness** as a vast, open sky
2. **See thoughts and emotions** as clouds passing through
3. **Notice**: The sky is not affected by the clouds
4. **Notice**: The sky doesn't push clouds away or cling to them
5. **Rest as the sky**, watching clouds come and go
6. **Recognize**: You are the sky, not the clouds

### The Ocean Practice

1. **Imagine your awareness** as a deep, vast ocean
2. **See thoughts and emotions** as waves on the surface
3. **Notice**: The depths remain calm regardless of surface activity
4. **Notice**: Waves are made of the same water as the ocean
5. **Rest in the depths**, allowing waves to rise and fall
6. **Recognize**: You are the ocean, not the waves

## Reflection Questions

- Can you sense the difference between the content of your thoughts and the awareness that knows them?
- What happens when you turn attention from the movie to the light that projects it?
- How does it feel to rest as the sky rather than identify as the clouds?
- What changes when you realize thoughts are the mind's own expression, not foreign invaders?
- Can you sense the "clear, cognizant awareness" that is always present?

## The Gradual Shift

This recognition doesn't usually happen all at once. It's a gradual process of:

1. **Familiarization**: Getting to know the difference between appearance and essence
2. **Practice**: Repeatedly turning attention from content to awareness
3. **Stabilization**: Resting in awareness for longer periods
4. **Recognition**: Moments where awareness recognizes its own nature
5. **Integration**: Living from this recognition more and more

## The Promise

When mind turns inward and recognizes its nature:

- **Thoughts lose their power** to disturb you
- **Emotions arise and dissolve** without leaving traces
- **Life's dramas** are seen as the play of awareness
- **Fear of death** dissolves (the ocean doesn't die when waves cease)
- **True peace** is found—not the absence of thoughts, but the recognition of what you truly are

This is not about achieving something new. It's about **recognizing what has always been present**—the clear, luminous awareness that is your true nature.

## The Wise Grandfather

Imagine watching a child build sandcastles on the beach. The child is completely absorbed, serious, invested. When a wave destroys the castle, there's drama, tears, frustration.

But you, watching, know it's just sand and water. You're not dismissive—you have compassion for the child's experience. But you're not caught in the drama. You see it as play.

This is how the awakened mind relates to life's events. Not with cold detachment, but with **spacious, compassionate awareness** that sees the play for what it is.

The sandcastles (careers, possessions, identities) are not dismissed as unimportant. But they're not taken as ultimately real either. They're the beautiful, temporary play of awareness.

## Integration Practice

This week:

1. **Multiple times a day**, pause and ask: "What is aware right now?"
2. **When caught in drama**, remember: "This is the movie, not the light"
3. **When emotions arise**, practice: "This is a wave, I am the ocean"
4. **Before sleep**, rest as awareness for a few minutes
5. **Upon waking**, recognize awareness before thoughts fully form

*The light has always been shining. The ocean has always been present. The sky has never been touched by clouds. Your true nature has never been lost—only forgotten. Remember.* 💡🌊☁️

**Next Steps**: Continue to practice turning mind inward. The recognition of your true nature is not a distant goal—it's available in this very moment, beneath the surface of thoughts, as the awareness reading these words right now.
