*"Our Buddha nature is perfect within us, right now. All we need to do is uncover it."*

## Mind as the Creator of Reality

Throughout this course, we've been exploring a profound truth: our reality—the things we think, feel, perceive, and how we respond to all of this—depends on our own mind.

This places great responsibility on us. But it's also deeply empowering, because our mind is workable and most intimately "us." The goal is to cultivate the mind and build mental strength.

### Meditation: Befriending the Mind

Meditation is the key to looking after our mind, ensuring it becomes our best friend and ally rather than a somewhat unpredictable and unnerving stranger.

Meditation is a process of:
- **Coming to know** our mind
- **Taming** its wild, reactive tendencies
- **Training** it to harness its power to address life's challenges

At present, the mind is often hijacked by habitual patterns—an accumulation of the past manifesting in the present. That kind of mind always lives in the past and is unable to meet the present afresh, on its own terms.

### The Basic Nature of Mind

On the most basic level, the mind is **clear and aware**. This cognizant quality uniquely distinguishes mind from everything else in the universe, especially inanimate objects.

Mind's cognizant quality is like a mirror: it reflects everything that appears in front of it. However, the mind is self-cognizing—it cognizes the object appearing in it and also cognizes itself.

This process creates the experience of subject and object, which happens entirely within the mind. Understanding this is key to understanding how we create our reality.

## The Three Components of Meditation Practice

All three components of meditation practice stem from this basic cognizant quality of mind.

### 1. Spaciousness: The Impartial Mirror

Spaciousness is the aspect of meditation where the basic clarity of mind (cognizance) is used to simply be with whatever reflects in the mirror of the mind.

It's characterized by impartial, open awareness where everything experienced—happy, sad, confused—is allowed to reflect equally, without any bias, judgment, or reaction.

Think of it as the mirror's quality of reflecting everything without preference or distortion.

### 2. Awareness: The Vigilant Observer

Awareness serves to oversee the process. It notices:
- Whether the mind is still being spacious
- Whether it has become narrow and distracted by something that has become "especially interesting"—like a thought, emotional state, or anxiety

Awareness is the "eyes" of our practice, maintaining perspective on the whole process.

### 3. Mindfulness: The Gentle Guide

When awareness notices distraction, mindfulness "kicks in" to help us come back to whatever we decided to focus on.

In shamatha without support, mindfulness continually brings our focus back to spacious, open awareness itself.

## The View: Discovering Buddha Nature

Here's where practice deepens profoundly. The view we bring to meditation transforms the entire experience.

### The Purpose of Life

All Buddhist teachings are premised on a simple observation: **the main purpose of life is to find happiness and fulfillment**.

The deep, internal happiness that is stabilized through meditation, when fully unlocked, is called **enlightenment**. Enlightenment is described as lasting happiness and is the true, innermost nature of the mind.

### What Is Buddha Nature?

Because this inner nature is limitless, it is the same for everyone. This is **Buddha nature**—our true identity and the source of limitless satisfaction.

Here's the revolutionary insight: **Our Buddha nature is perfect within us, right now.**

We don't need to create it, earn it, or become worthy of it. All we need to do is uncover it by letting go of constantly focusing our mind on its experiences, away from its essence and nature.

## Good in the Beginning, Middle, and End

This understanding of Buddha nature gives rise to a framework that can transform not just meditation practice, but every action in our lives.

### Good in the Beginning: Motivation

Before we practice, we generate the aspiration to dedicate our practice to the enlightenment of all beings.

This motivation is based on the awareness that "we and all sentient beings fundamentally have Buddha nature as our innermost essence." Realizing this leads to freedom from ignorance and the end of suffering.

This isn't just a nice sentiment—it fundamentally shifts our practice from self-improvement to something much vaster. We're not just trying to feel better; we're uncovering our true nature for the benefit of all beings.

### Good in the Middle: Attitude and View

This is the attitude we take during the practice itself. It stems from the realization that our Buddha nature is "already perfectly accomplished" and intact.

This view encourages us to:
- **Relax**: There's nothing to achieve or fix
- **Let go of goal-orientedness**: We're not trying to get somewhere
- **Enter with openness and curiosity**: We're simply uncovering what's already present

This is radically different from striving or self-improvement. We're not building something new; we're removing the obscurations that hide what's already perfect.

### Good at the End: Dedication

After practice, we mentally dedicate the results of our efforts toward the enlightenment of all beings and their ultimate well-being and happiness.

This dedication prevents the practice from becoming self-centered and connects our individual effort to the welfare of all beings.

## Meditation in Action: Conversation with View

When we bring this framework into conversation, something profound happens.

### Before the Conversation: Good in the Beginning

We consciously generate the motivation that the conversation might help our conversation partner find their Buddha nature and be free from suffering.

This isn't about fixing or teaching them—it's about creating space for their inherent wisdom to emerge.

### During the Conversation: Good in the Middle

We enter the conversation with the view that we and our conversation partner are already fundamentally okay—"Buddhas to be."

This view transforms how we listen and respond:
- We're not trying to change or improve the other person
- We're not defending or proving ourselves
- We're simply present with another being who shares our fundamental nature

### The Three Principles in Action

**Mindfulness**: Focus on what the other person is saying—deep listening without planning our response.

**Awareness**: Monitor whether focus is maintained or if distraction has occurred.

**Spaciousness**: The open, accepting space of awareness that holds the conversation, allowing us to notice our own mind, subtle physical reactions, body language, and the environment.

### After the Conversation: Good at the End

We mentally dedicate the results of the conversation toward the enlightenment of all beings and their ultimate well-being and happiness.

## Transforming Every Action

This framework—Good in the Beginning, Good in the Middle, and Good at the End, combined with mindfulness, awareness, and spaciousness—can be applied to every single action or the entire day.

### Morning: Good in the Beginning
Set your motivation for the day: "May my actions today benefit all beings and help uncover the Buddha nature in myself and others."

### Throughout the Day: Good in the Middle
Maintain the view that you and everyone you encounter are fundamentally okay, already complete. Bring mindfulness, awareness, and spaciousness to your activities.

### Evening: Good at the End
Dedicate whatever good you've done toward the enlightenment and happiness of all beings.

## The Revolutionary Shift

Understanding Buddha nature changes everything about practice:

**Without this view**, meditation can become:
- Another self-improvement project
- A way to fix what's wrong with us
- A goal-oriented striving that creates tension

**With this view**, meditation becomes:
- A process of uncovering what's already perfect
- A relaxation into our true nature
- A joyful recognition rather than an anxious achievement

This is why the view is called "good in the middle"—it makes the practice itself fundamentally different.

## Practice: Bringing the View into Your Week

This week, experiment with the complete framework:

### In Formal Meditation
1. **Beginning**: Set the motivation to practice for the benefit of all beings
2. **Middle**: Rest in the view that your Buddha nature is already perfect—nothing to achieve, just uncover
3. **End**: Dedicate the merit of your practice to all beings

### In Daily Activities
Choose one activity each day and apply the framework:
1. **Before**: Set the motivation that this activity might benefit others
2. **During**: Maintain the view that you're already fundamentally okay; bring mindfulness, awareness, and spaciousness
3. **After**: Dedicate any good that came from the activity

### In Conversations
1. **Before**: Generate the wish that the conversation might help both of you connect with your Buddha nature
2. **During**: Hold the view that you're both "Buddhas to be"; practice deep listening with spaciousness
3. **After**: Dedicate the positive energy of genuine connection

## The Path of Uncovering

The journey of meditation isn't about becoming something we're not. It's about uncovering what we've always been.

Our Buddha nature—clear, aware, limitless, and perfect—is already present. The habitual patterns, the reactive emotions, the constant mental chatter—these are like clouds obscuring the sun. They're temporary and workable.

The sun is always shining. We just need to let the clouds pass.

*What would change in your practice if you truly believed your Buddha nature is already perfect, right now?*
