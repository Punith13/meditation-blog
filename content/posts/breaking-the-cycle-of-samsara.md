We began by reflecting on how we get trapped in a cycle of frustration and dissatisfaction. The Sanskrit term used for this is **samsara**. It literally means "cyclic existence." This process is driven by **karma**, which refers to our actions and their results.

## The Cycle of Samsara

Here's how this cycle unfolds:

### Past Actions Condition Perception

The way we experience our reality right now is a direct result of past actions, committed with our body, speech, and particularly our mind. These past actions condition how we perceive ourselves, our world, and other people, and how we evaluate situations. 

This conditioning functions like a pair of colored glasses: coloring everything we perceive.

### Perceptions Lead to Emotions and Actions

The way we perceive things gives rise to emotions, thoughts, and interpretations, which in turn trigger further actions of our body, speech, and mind. 

Especially when emotions are strong, they distort our reality: we might say or do things we later regret once the emotion calms down. These emotions prevent us from relating to other people on their own terms, and we only see them through the lens of our own self-interest.

### The Self-Perpetuating Cycle

This chain of events—past actions shaping present perceptions, which then determine our current actions—sets in motion a cycle. We constantly make efforts, often ending up in the same place again and again, feeling like we are going around in circles. 

This "going around in circles" is the intuitive way to relate to samsara. The deeper driver of this cycle is our wish to be happy, find fulfillment, and satisfaction, but we often look for it in places where it cannot be found, causing us to keep going in this loop. 

This **"karmic momentum"** means our mind is a bit out of control, acting based on its own past habits.

## Breaking the Cycle through Awareness and Meditation

The practice of meditation helps us bring this karmic momentum, driven by our own mind, into direct experience. In meditation we become acutely aware of just how restless our mind is when it is constantly driven by the pull of thoughts and emotions, or, conversely, how it gets bogged down in dullness and unawareness.

### The Essence of Meditation

The essence of meditation is to learn to **stay centered in awareness** instead of being pulled into the "whirlwind of thoughts." This means not running away from thoughts but also not being pulled into them.

We often deal with unwanted thoughts by:
- **Suppressing them** (like holding a beach ball underwater, which only makes it resurface stronger)
- **Running away/numbing our minds** (like addiction)

The meditation approach is different: **not suppressing, not running away, and not indulging**, but staying present and allowing thoughts and emotions to come and go.

Through this practice, gradually thoughts and experiences lose their hold over us, and we connect with a part of our mind that is not caught up in this conditioned process of cycling around. We slowly diffuse our deeply entrenched habitual patterns and connect with our **unconditioned, pure awareness**.

## Understanding Awareness

**Awareness** is "that which notices" a thought, sensation, or perception, and is distinct from the thought or sensation itself. It's more panoramic and not limited to a single object. This awareness is "that part of you that decides not to go along with them [thoughts]."

### Meditation Practice

By observing physical sensations (like a body scan) and focusing on the breath, we develop awareness. The practice involves noticing thoughts and emotions without getting lost in them, instead returning to the anchor (e.g., the breath). This helps us notice the mind's tendency to wander and to see the possibility of not going along with every thought.

### Avoiding Suppression or Indulgence

The meditation approach explored is different from our usual patterns: not suppressing, not running away, and not indulging, but staying present and allowing thoughts and emotions to come and go, thus losing their hold over us.

## Basic Meditation Instruction

Here's how to practice meditation:

### 1. Posture

Begin by sitting in a good meditation posture, which means sitting upright, alert yet relaxed, and comfortable. This posture helps cultivate wakefulness and presence.

### 2. Our Senses

Leave your eyes and ears, all your senses, open, not shutting out anything we experience.

### 3. Body Scan

Gently bring your awareness to the sensations in your body, almost like a "photocopier scanning your body." Start with your forehead and gradually move down, observing sensations in your face, neck, shoulders, and arms. 

Also, become aware of where your body touches your cushion or chair and how your clothes touch your body. The instruction is to simply be aware of whatever you feel, allowing yourself to notice if sensations are pleasant or painful, without being drawn into stories or reactions about them.

### 4. Focus on Breath

The primary anchor for meditation is the flow of your breathing. When breathing in, simply know you are breathing in; when breathing out, simply know you are breathing out. The aim is to be present with every moment of every in-breath and out-breath.

### 5. Returning to the Breath

As soon as you notice your mind has wandered or you've been pulled into thoughts and emotions, simply come back to the breath, again and again.

## The Cognitive Patterns That Keep Us Stuck

In our deeper exploration, we look more closely at the cognitive patterns that cause our mind to remain stuck in the unhelpful habits of mistaken perception, emotions, and unskillful actions, which keep us trapped in the vicious cycle of samsara. 

They are so much part of us that we often don't realize they're there, until we step back and reflect on them:

### 1. Expecting Permanence

Our mind habitually sees things as permanent, even though everything is constantly changing and impermanent.

### 2. Seeing Things as Singular

Our mind tends to see things as single entities, making us grasp and become attached to them. In reality, everything breaks down into many interdependent parts.

### 3. Viewing Things as Independent

We see permanent, singular things as independent, when in fact, everything is interdependent, relying on causes and conditions.

## The Illusion of Self

These biases particularly apply to how we view ourselves. Though our body and mind are impermanent, multiple, and interdependent, they are the basis for us constructing a **non-existent identity**: a permanent, single, and independent "self." 

This non-existent self, then, embarks on a futile search for happiness.

## The Path Forward

By bringing these unconscious cognitive patterns into conscious awareness through insight practice, we can begin to dissolve them. 

What dawns through this process is our **true identity**: open, spacious, wisdom and compassion.

## Practice This Week

1. **Sit for 10-15 minutes daily** using the meditation instructions above
2. **Notice when you're caught in cycles** of repetitive thoughts or behaviors
3. **Observe your cognitive biases** - when do you expect permanence? When do you see yourself as separate?
4. **Return to awareness** whenever you notice you've been pulled into the whirlwind

Remember: The goal isn't to stop thoughts, but to stop being controlled by them. Each time you notice and return to the breath, you're weakening the karmic momentum and strengthening your connection to pure awareness.

*May you find freedom from the cycles that bind you.* 🙏
