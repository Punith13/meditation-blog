## The Thread That Runs Throughout

The thread that binds together our exploration is how our mind is an active agent in creating our reality: **with our thoughts and perceptions we create the world, our world.**

If the reality created by our own mind is a product of distorted cognition (referred to as "impure mind"), our actions will contribute to a cycle of unsatisfactoriness (samsara). If our mind is guided by undistorted cognition (pure mind), our actions will lead to happiness and fulfillment, and can ultimately bring about the state of unconditioned peace and wisdom (nirvana).

## Meditation: A Process of Coming to Know Our Mind

Through meditation practice we come to know our own mind. In the beginning, meditation practice helps us bring into direct experience just how restless our mind is when it is constantly driven by the pull of thoughts and emotions, or, conversely, how it gets bogged down in dullness and unawareness.

We often deal with unwanted thoughts by suppressing them or by running away/numbing our minds (like addiction). The approach we take in meditation is different: we train in remaining in awareness, and by staying present and allowing thoughts and emotions to come and go, they gradually lose their hold over us.

This allows us to connect with a part of our mind that is not caught up in the world created by our thoughts and perceptions. We slowly diffuse our deeply entrenched habitual patterns and connect with our unconditioned, pure awareness.

## The Cognitive Patterns That Create Samsara

There are three subtle cognitive patterns that distort our cognition:

### 1. Permanence
Viewing what is impermanent and always changing as permanent and unchanging.

### 2. Singularity
Viewing what in reality is a multiplicity of interconnected elements as single entities.

### 3. Independence
Viewing our deeply interwoven, interdependent reality as consisting of independent, discrete entities.

When these three cognitive habits come together, our mind creates a sense of **"self"** or **"personal identity"** that is entirely constructed and unreal. Through a process of investigation we can learn to see through this, and come home to our true nature, our deep inner nature we have so long ago lost sight of.

## Exploring Impermanence

The first cognitive habit we explore is the tendency to lose sight of the fundamental reality that **everything in our world is changing**. Nothing is the same, even from one moment to the next.

Reflecting on impermanence is a fundamental practice to cultivate wisdom, reduce suffering, and live more authentically in the present moment.

## Contemplation Practice: Impermanence

Here's how to engage in formal contemplation practice:

### Set Intention

Generate the intention to face your mind's habits and transform it to be more aligned with reality, cultivating wisdom and compassion.

### Body Scan

Begin by resting attention lightly on the breath, noticing how each breath is fresh, new, and different. Then extend awareness to the body, experiencing directly how everything in your body is constantly changing (e.g., heart beating, blood moving, shifting sensations).

### Mind

Bring attention to your mind, watching the constant "traffic" or stream of experiences.

### Personal Identity

Imagine looking in a mirror and asking: **"Am I the same person I was a minute ago? Yesterday? Last year? 20 years ago?"**

Consider a childhood photo (e.g., at 5 years old) and question if your body, mind, knowledge, neuroses, or habits are the same; realize that they have completely changed. 

Note that biologically, every cell in the body is replaced within a few years. While there might be a "vague resemblance" or a "flow-on effect" from past to present, this is not true sameness, but rather cause and effect.

**The Deep Question:** Though we feel there is "something" in us that remains unchanged, what is that? Our body constantly changes, our mind constantly changes, so what is it that is constant and unchanging? And if that is really us, why are we so preoccupied with all these parts of us that are subject to impermanence and change: our aging and failing body, our jobs, our opinions, possessions, relationships, mental decline...

### World

Extend awareness to the world around you. Notice how objects and places (e.g., room, furniture) look solid and enduring, but in reality, are constantly getting older, moment by moment.

### Interpersonal Reflection

Picture other people in your mind, reflecting on their lives, aging, and eventual death, noting that everything about them is changing moment by moment. Recall how relationships change, like friends becoming distant or strangers becoming friends.

### Universal Scope

Let your mind consider larger entities like oceans, climate, glaciers, houses, planets, stars, galaxies, and the universe, observing that all are in constant motion and changing.

### Death

Specifically, contemplate your own death by acknowledging:

1. **It is absolutely certain you will die**
2. **It is completely uncertain when you will die**
3. **At the time of death, only the state of your mind and your ability to let go will help**, as attachments will only cause suffering

## Making Friends with Impermanence

Through deep and repeated reflection we will come to see that **impermanence is like that slightly unnerving stranger who after a while turns out to be your best friend.**

### Benefits of Embracing Impermanence

#### Aligning Mind with Reality and Cultivating Wisdom

Reflection on impermanence helps to transform your mind to make it more aligned with reality, which is what wisdom is. This wisdom then enables the removal and prevention of suffering for oneself and others, which is compassion.

#### Understanding "Who We Are"

It is a key method for exploring the question of "Who are we, really?" and identifying what we are not that we may have always thought we were. By observing constant change, it challenges the notion of an unchanging "self."

#### Opportunity for Growth and Relief

Impermanence allows for a reset, a restock, and an opportunity for growth, particularly spiritual growth. It brings a sense of relief from being stuck as past versions of oneself.

#### Reducing Anxiety

The mind's strong tendency to fix and control our reality creates an anxious situation. This anxiety is the faint echo of a deep knowing that we cannot grasp and fixate what in reality is always fluid and changing; things are ultimately beyond our control.

Realizing and accepting this reduces the anxiety stemming from attempts to control and predict life. The more we let go, the more we find inner peace and contentment within ourselves, and an ability to skillfully navigate and work with change, rather than live in denial of it.

#### Encouraging Present Moment Enjoyment

Deep reflection on impermanence helps us to appreciate and value life now, rather than waiting until it's "too late" (like at death). By letting go of clinging to a fixed reality, we can start to enjoy life and find joy beyond external things and mental projections.

#### Preparation for Death

Contemplation on impermanence gives us access to the wisdom that dawns at the moment of death: the realization of what is truly of importance in life. Through this we will be able to live well, and when our time comes, die well and without regrets.

## Practice This Week

1. **Daily Contemplation**: Spend 10-15 minutes with the impermanence contemplation practice outlined above
2. **Notice Change**: Throughout your day, pause and notice what is changing in this very moment
3. **Question Identity**: When you catch yourself saying "I am..." ask: "Is this really who I am, or just a temporary state?"
4. **Let Go**: Practice releasing your grip on one thing you've been trying to control
5. **Appreciate Now**: Notice something beautiful or meaningful in this present moment, knowing it won't last forever

## Reflection Questions

- What parts of yourself do you cling to as "permanent"?
- How does accepting impermanence change your relationship with loss?
- What would it mean to live fully, knowing everything is temporary?
- Can you sense the part of you that witnesses all this change?

*In the dance of constant change, find the stillness that watches. That is your true home.* 🌊

**Remember**: Impermanence is not something to fear or resist. It is the very nature of reality, and by aligning with it, we find freedom, wisdom, and peace.
