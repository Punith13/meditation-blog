*"In order to have more reliable access to the happiness that is more dependent on our own mind, we need to look after our mind, and deeply come to know it."*

## Reconnecting with Our Fundamental Pursuit

All sentient beings—*semchen* in Tibetan, meaning "beings endowed with a mind"—share a fundamental pursuit: to avoid pain, frustration, and dissatisfaction, and to move toward happiness, fulfillment, and satisfaction.

This basic premise underlies all Buddhist teachings. But it raises an essential question: **Where do we find the deep and lasting happiness we're all seeking?**

### Two Types of Happiness

As we explored previously, happiness comes from two distinct sources:

**External Happiness** is based on the senses and the external world. While it can be pleasant, it's inevitably uncertain. No matter how we pursue it, there's often a shadow side of insecurity and anxiety. The Buddha grouped this unstable sensory happiness together with suffering, calling it *dukkha*—unsatisfactoriness.

**Internal Happiness** doesn't depend on external factors. It's happiness without a reason, a state of contentment and inner peace that arises from within.

To have more reliable access to this internal happiness, we need to look after our mind and come to know it deeply. This is the purpose of meditation practice.

## Shamatha Without Support

In our previous practice, we used the breath as an anchor—a support for our attention. But there's another approach: **shamatha without the support of an object**.

### What Changes?

Instead of using mindfulness to focus on the breath, we use mindfulness to rest in spacious, open awareness itself.

This might sound abstract, but it's actually quite natural. Rather than narrowing attention to a single point (the breath), we open attention to the entire field of experience while remaining centered and present.

### Why Practice This Way?

This style of meditation is excellent preparation for carrying the state of meditation into everyday activities. After all, in daily life we're not focusing on our breath—we're engaged with the world around us. Shamatha without support teaches us to maintain meditative presence while fully engaged with experience.

## The Three Principles in Open Awareness

The three principles of meditation—mindfulness, awareness, and spaciousness—work together in this practice, but with a subtle shift in emphasis.

### Mindfulness: Resting in the Center

Mindfulness provides focus to our mind's basic quality of cognizance. In shamatha without support, we use mindfulness to focus on and remain with what could be loosely described as our "center of awareness."

This center isn't a physical location—it's the quality of being present and aware, resting in spacious, open cognizance of the entire field of our thoughts, emotions, and perceptions.

### Awareness: The Vigilant Observer

Awareness uses our mind's cognizance to oversee the meditation practice. It acts as a "guard" to ensure our focus remains on being spacious.

Awareness performs two functions:
- It registers when our mind is resting in our center of awareness
- It notices when our mind has wandered into engaging with thoughts, emotions, and perceptions

As soon as we notice the mind has wandered, we employ mindfulness to bring focus back to our center of awareness.

### Spaciousness: The Accepting Presence

Spaciousness means being with whatever thoughts, emotions, and perceptions arise in our experience. It's a basic attitude of friendliness and openness toward our own mind.

With spaciousness, we:
- Don't fight or suppress what arises
- Don't get carried away by thoughts and emotions
- Simply allow experience to be as it is

### The Light Touch

As before, we apply these principles with a light touch:
- **25% mindfulness**: Gentle focus on our center of awareness
- **25% awareness**: Vigilant observation of the practice
- **50% spaciousness**: Open, accepting presence

## Meditation in Action: The Art of Conversation

One of the most powerful ways to practice meditation in action is through conversation. Every conversation offers an opportunity to apply mindfulness, awareness, and spaciousness in real time.

### Mindfulness in Conversation

Mindfulness determines where we place our cognitive focus. In conversation, this means:

- **Being present and deeply listening**: Not just hearing words, but truly receiving what the other person is communicating
- **Maintaining the thread**: Keeping track of the purpose and topic of the conversation
- **Knowing your role**: Are you mainly explaining yourself, or are you focused on understanding the other person?

Without mindfulness, we drift into our own thoughts, planning what we'll say next, or getting lost in tangents.

### Awareness in Conversation

Awareness oversees the whole process—it's the "eyes" of our practice. In conversation, awareness notices:

- Whether we're still focusing in the right place
- When we've become distracted into our own train of thought
- The quality of our presence and engagement

Awareness helps us catch ourselves when we've stopped listening and started rehearsing our response.

### Spaciousness in Conversation

Spaciousness is the open, accepting space that holds the entire conversation. It allows us to:

- **Notice our own mind**: Observing thoughts and reactions as they arise
- **Sense subtle physical reactions**: Tension, excitement, defensiveness—these often precede emotional and verbal reactions
- **Let go of preconceptions**: Releasing agendas and expectations that make us anxious or awkward
- **Flow with the conversation**: Responding naturally rather than habitually

When we notice subtle physical messages—a tightening in the chest, a quickening of breath—we can prevent the interaction from snowballing into a habitual response. This awareness creates space for a more authentic, present exchange.

### The Result: Genuine Connection

When we bring all three principles into conversation, something shifts. We're no longer just exchanging words—we're creating a space of genuine connection. The conversation flows more naturally. We feel more present. The other person feels truly heard.

This is meditation in action.

## Practice: Mindful Conversation

This week, experiment with bringing meditation into your conversations:

### Before the Conversation
1. Take a moment to settle into your center of awareness
2. Set an intention to be present and listen deeply
3. Notice any agendas or expectations you're bringing

### During the Conversation
1. **Mindfulness**: Keep your focus on truly listening and maintaining the thread of the conversation
2. **Awareness**: Notice when your mind wanders into planning your response or getting distracted
3. **Spaciousness**: Stay open to whatever arises—in yourself and in the other person

### Noticing Physical Cues
Pay special attention to subtle physical sensations:
- Tension in your shoulders or jaw
- Changes in your breathing
- Sensations in your chest or stomach

These physical messages often signal emotional reactions before they become verbal. Noticing them creates space for choice.

### After the Conversation
Reflect briefly:
- Were there moments of genuine presence and connection?
- When did you lose focus or get caught in habitual patterns?
- What did you notice about the role of spaciousness?

## From Cushion to Conversation

The journey from formal meditation to meditation in action isn't about maintaining a meditative state while living life. It's about bringing the qualities of a settled, aware mind into all our activities.

Conversation is an ideal practice ground because it's:
- **Immediate**: It happens in real time with no room for delay
- **Relational**: It involves another person, adding complexity
- **Common**: We have multiple opportunities every day
- **Revealing**: It shows us our patterns and habits clearly

When we can maintain mindfulness, awareness, and spaciousness in conversation, we're truly practicing meditation in action.

## The Deeper Purpose

Ultimately, this practice isn't just about having better conversations—though that's a wonderful benefit. It's about discovering that the qualities we cultivate in meditation can infuse every moment of our lives.

The center of awareness we rest in during shamatha without support is always available. The mindfulness, awareness, and spaciousness we practice on the cushion can be brought into every interaction, every activity, every moment.

This is how meditation becomes not something we do, but something we are.

*What would change in your relationships if you brought just a little more mindfulness, awareness, and spaciousness to your conversations?*
