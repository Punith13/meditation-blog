*"We are what we think. All that we are, arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts, we make the world."*

## The Power of Mind

These ancient words reveal a profound truth: our experience of reality is, to a much greater degree than we normally believe, a creation of our mind. When we speak of "thoughts" here, we mean something broader than just conscious thinking—we're talking about the entire spectrum of mind, including feelings, subconscious processes, and sensory perceptions.

## How We Create Our World

### Thoughts and Emotions

Our thoughts are subjective representations of our world. We see reality through the "colored glasses" of our past conditioning. Strong emotions like anger and desire particularly distort our view of reality.

Have you ever felt embarrassed about what you said or did under the influence of anger or desire once the emotional wave calmed down? This is evidence of how emotions distort our perception.

### Sense Perceptions

Even our senses are largely determined by our mind. What we experience as sights and sounds are, in reality, particle waves and vibrations that have no inherent color or sound. Our brain interprets and creates these experiences based on prior experience, expectations, and beliefs.

Consider these examples:
- Squares on a checkerboard with identical shades of grey appear different to our eyes
- Heat in a sauna feels satisfying, but the same heat in a car stuck in traffic feels like torture
- What we hear is shaped by our expectations and prior input

As cognitive scientist Anil Seth explains, our brain is constantly "hallucinating" our conscious reality, using sensory data to update and refine its predictions about the world.

## Pure Mind vs. Impure Mind

*"Speak or act with an impure mind, and trouble will follow you, as the wheel follows the ox that draws the cart. Speak or act with a pure mind, and happiness will follow you, as your shadow, unshakeable."*

These terms aren't moralistic judgments. Rather, they describe whether our mind is "in sync with reality" or "out of sync" in its search for happiness:

- **Impure mind**: Acts based on a distorted view of reality, and though seeking happiness, creates trouble for itself and others
- **Pure mind**: Perceives reality more clearly and acts in harmony with it, naturally leading to happiness

## The Law of Karma

Our actions of body and speech, whether committed with a pure or impure mind, create accumulated habitual patterns that lead to corresponding results. This is karma—an infallible law of cause and effect.

These habitual patterns shape:
- How our mind creates our world
- How we relate to our world
- What we experience in the future

## Samsara: The Cycle of Suffering

Samsara describes a vicious cycle where:
1. Current perceptions are shaped by past habits
2. These perceptions inform present actions
3. Present actions create new habitual imprints
4. These imprints determine future experiences

We become trapped in patterns, "going around in circles." Recognizing this within ourselves is the first step toward change.

## Nirvana: The State Beyond Suffering

The opposite of samsara, nirvana is the "state beyond suffering and sorrow"—a state of awakening. It is the realization that all desired happiness and its causes are found within our own mind.

Both samsara and nirvana are states of our own mind, not physical places.

## Our True Nature

Here's the paradox: **we are not what we think**.

A sense of identity based on things in our world, on our body and mind, is a falsely constructed identity. This false identity causes us to constantly experience hope, fear, and insecurity.

Instead, there is a deeper reality—an unchanging, pure awareness, a "sky-like nature of mind" that underlies life and death and offers lasting satisfaction.

## The Purpose of Meditation

Meditation is about connecting with this intrinsic awareness, which exists even when thoughts and emotions are absent. It's about:

- Bringing the mind home from its busyness and distractions
- Exploring the hidden flaws of our mind that prevent this connection
- Discovering the unchanging awareness that is our true nature

The journey requires us to fully explore samsara—to understand our patterns and conditioning—before we can realize nirvana.

## Practice: Observing Your Mind

This week, try this simple practice:

1. Notice when strong emotions arise
2. Observe how they color your perception of reality
3. Ask yourself: "Is this emotion showing me reality as it is, or reality as my mind is creating it?"
4. In moments of calm, try to sense the awareness that observes all thoughts and emotions

Remember: the goal isn't to eliminate thoughts or emotions, but to recognize the pure awareness that witnesses them all.

*With our thoughts, we make the world. What world are you creating today?*
